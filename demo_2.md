Let's try our hand at a very famous computing problem with lots of real-world variants and applications - ***the knapsack problem***.

The idea is that we have a backpack with a size or weight limit that constrains how many things we can put inside. We have lots of items we want to put into the knapsack. However, they won't all fit. Choosing the optimal combination of items that meets size or weight constraints while maximizing value might seem doable with a small example, but this becomes a difficult problem very quickly.
